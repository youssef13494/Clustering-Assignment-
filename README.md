# Clustering-Assignment-
# Description:
• Consider this dataset which is scraped from IMDB’s official website in the 
imdb_top_2000_movies.csv file. It contains the ratings of top 2000 movies between 1921 
and 2010.
• Write a program in any programming language you prefer to group the movies based on 
the similarity of user IMDB ratings.
• You should use k-means algorithm to cluster the movies to k clusters
• Number of clusters (k) will be provided from the user as an input.
• Initial centroid should be choosing randomly.
• You should use Euclidean distance as your distance function.
• You should detect outlier data (if exists).
• The final output of your program should show k lists of users and show outlier user’s 
records.
